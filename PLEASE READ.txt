If you are a modder (one who uses the Module System, not text-editing and Morgh's/TweakMB) then you can absolutely combine this mod with your own or any others you have source code for! I actually designed it in a way that I hoped would make it easy. It uses the ModMerger framework; if you're not familiar with this, it allows you to put your mod's changes into separate files rather directly editing the module files. To merge in Custom Troop Trees, you should not have to directly change any of your module files, just add the new files (all starting with cstm_) along with the modmerger_ and util_ files. You'll then need to run modmerger_installer and follow the prompts to install. If you already had ModMerger set up, remember to add "cstm" to your modmerger_options. With that all done, you might be lucky and have it work right away, or you might need to make changes to make it work. The Constable dialog options won't work for example if your mod doesn't have Diplomacy's Constable troop. You'll very likely want to edit numbers like the numbers of tiers, levels per tier and funds per level for balance purposes. Overall it will hopefully be flexible enough to work with your mod without much extra work, but there have already been examples of this definitely not happening and I'll keep working to try to improve that.
